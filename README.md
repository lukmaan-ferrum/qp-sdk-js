# TODO

SDK code is in `src/`, with an example in `example/`. The remaining directories are only used in hardhat testing, and won't be published to npm.

### Test
First need to start local hardhat node with `hh node`, then deploy mock contracts with `hh ignition deploy ignition/modules/QP.ts --network localhost`. Then run tests with `hh test`

(This can be improved)
